Books: SFML Game development by example,
Beginning C++ through game programming


SFML - simple and fast multimedia language

game designing is different from game programming - search on that


Game engines - learning to make one from scratch in this course
	
ECS Game programming - Entities, Components, Systems.
	Is a software design paradigm, and can be used for all software, not limited to gaming only

Object Oriented Programming - 
	Object Oriented programming used the concept of Objects and Inheritance to implement specific functionality
	Object Oriented design (in games) is the process of strictly using OOP in order to design the architecture of the game engine and the entities within it.
	
	Entity - Anything object in the game: player, platform, tile, design
	Component - properties attached to entities
		Components are pure data
	Systems - Code/logic that drives the behaviour in the game
		movement, rendering, sound, physics 
		
Engine Architecture:

	Game Engine
